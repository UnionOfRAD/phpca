Roadmap (tasks listed in decreasing priority)

* Make error/warning know which rule has caused them
* Add XML output to comply with phpcs for ci integration
* Port "interesting" rules from phpcs
* write a source code highlighter that highlights violations in the source code and attaches the error message as popup
* write output statistics that aggregate how often each rule has been violated (these are the rules you must teach the developers)
* trySeekTokenId -> seekTokenId
